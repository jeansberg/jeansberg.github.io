Hello! This is my personal Github page. You can find my repositories [here](https://github.com/jeansberg/repos). Read on for more details about my projects.

# Projects
## [Walk and Talk](https://github.com/jeansberg/WalkAndTalk)
Walk and Talk was initially developed as an entry for *My First Game Jam: Summer 2017*. Game design and writing is done by [Airova](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtaSP80xWusu4QYIdQ2oQOw)

> You're out for a walk with your very chatty friend. Conversation is one thing, but this friend just never stops chattering on, bouncing > from topic to topic faster than you can think. You'd better pay attention, though, or you won't be friends anymore. And you can hardly > afford to lose a friend. On the other hand, don't forget to watch where you're going, or you might get run over by a car.

The current release can be found at https://microbrood.itch.io/walkandtalk.
