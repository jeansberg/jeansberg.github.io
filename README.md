Hello! This is my personal Github page. You can find my repositories [here](https://github.com/jeansberg/repos). Read on for more details about my projects.

## Projects
### [Walk and Talk](https://github.com/jeansberg/WalkAndTalk)
You're out for a walk with your very chatty friend. Conversation is one thing, but this friend just never stops chattering on, bouncing from topic to topic faster than you can think. You'd better pay attention, though, or you won't be friends anymore. And you can hardly afford to lose a friend. On the other hand, don't forget to watch where you're going, or you might get run over by a car.

Walk and Talk was initially developed as an entry for My First Game Jam: Summer 2017. Game design and writing is done by [Airova](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtaSP80xWusu4QYIdQ2oQOw)

The current release can be found at https://microbrood.itch.io/walkandtalk.

### [The Great Deep]()
A side-scrolling shooter made with Lua/Love2D

This is a project I started in order to learn Lua and Love2D. I wrote a series of blog posts to share my journey.
