Hello! This is my personal Github page. Read on for more details about my projects.

# Projects
## [Space Pirates!](https://github.com/jeansberg/SpacePirates)
Space Pirates! was an entry in the fourth *Dragon Jam* game jam. I had the privilege to work with a game designer, an artist and a composer - all very talented people! The entry was uploaded to [itch.io](https://18dramos.itch.io/space-pirates).
> Goal: Travel from point to point looking for the secret key and fight pirates along the way. Upgrade your ship with better stats and weapons to become strong enough to defeat the final boss. Find cities and merchants to repair your ship.

* Design: Diego Ramos
* Art: Gillian Sneve
* Sound: Coatedpolecat

## [Walk and Talk](https://github.com/jeansberg/WalkAndTalk)
Walk and Talk was initially developed as an entry for *My First Game Jam: Summer 2017*. Original idea, design and writing is done by [Airova](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtaSP80xWusu4QYIdQ2oQOw).

> You're out for a walk with your very chatty friend. Conversation is one thing, but this friend just never stops chattering on, bouncing from topic to topic faster than you can think. You'd better pay attention, though, or you won't be friends anymore. And you can hardly afford to lose a friend. On the other hand, don't forget to watch where you're going, or you might get run over by a car.

The current release can be found at [itch.io](https://microbrood.itch.io/walkandtalk).

## [The Great Deep](https://github.com/jeansberg/GreatDeep)
The Great Deep is a side-scrolling shooter game prototype I made in order to learn Lua and Love2D. I wrote a series of blog posts to share my journey.
